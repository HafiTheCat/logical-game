# ðŸ‘‹Hi
I've always been fascinated with logic problems since I was a child, and everyone eventually comes across the classic **Logical** puzzle.
A grid with all possible combinations is provided as below. The purpose is to fill out the grid with true and false values in order to obtain an accurate representation of the condition of the entities concerned.
There are hints in the form of statements to assist you discover the solution.

That is why I began working on this project in **2022**.

Unfortunately, I haven't had much time for the project, thus the current state is just a rendered grid with adjustable size.

I hope to finish it one day, but I'm probably too busy with other projects at this point.

# ðŸ”ŒPossible Extentions
The grid view should work, therefore the only things that are lacking are user interaction, the display of hints, and the solution check.

# ðŸ“” Usage
`npm install`

`npm run dev`
